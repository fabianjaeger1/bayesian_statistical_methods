       "\n",
       "The course focusses mostly on showing how to use statistical tools, rather than giving a detailed introduction to probability and statistics. There are many great books and courses on this topic, which I encourage you to look at before the lectures. The resources listed here all are available online, either directly or through the ETH library.\n",

       "- Weighing the odds, a course in probability and statistics, Williams, 2001 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117170967205503). A good introduction to probability theory and statistics with a high level of mathematical rigour.\n",
       "- Bayesian Data Analysis, Gelman, 2013 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117222397805503). The title says it all.\n",
       "- Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, MacKay, 2003 [Link](http://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). Heavy on the information theory but also covers inference methods nicely. The exercises come with solutions.\n",
       "- Practical Statistics for Astronomers, Wall, 2012 [ETH library](https://eth.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_ETH/lshl64/alma99117170816205503). Short, with a focus on practical applications. Many of the examples and exercises are from astrophysics but are generally applicable, especially for the physical sciences, which often come a bit short in general statistics textbooks. Solutions and data sets are [available online](https://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/jvw/ASTROSTATS/pracstats_web_ed2.html).\n",
